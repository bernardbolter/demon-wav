                        <p>DEMON WAV IS A MEDIA PLATFORM AND EXPRESSIVE VEHICLE FOR THE BRAND DEMON. DEMON WAV ENABLES THE BRAND TO INVESTIGATE THE THREASHOLD BETWEEN PRODUCT AND ART.</p>
                        <p>IT IS A COLLABORATIVE PLATFORM BORN FROM THE JOINING OF THE VISION OF A COLLECTIVE OF ARTISTIC DIRECTORS INCLUDING jonas fuerste, leonhard laupichler, philipp bulk, sophia brinkgerd AND ALBERTO DEON, WITH THE LATTER BEING THE METAPHORIC AND ACTUALLY VOICE OF THE PROJECT.</p>
                        {/* <p>Demon WAV hatched from the sheer vocation of Alberto Deon to make music. Semantically, WAV is a direct reference to the audio file format known for best preserving the quality of sounds. The expression WAV stands as an etiological allegory to the universe of computer music, and the way it impacted a generational taste.</p>
                        <p>In Demon WAV, music becomes the chosen channel for interweaving cultural and autobiographical references. Expanding the idea of brand, and product into a multifaceted reality that ultimately becomes a mirror to the self.</p>
